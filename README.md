After researching the monkees on Google i discovered from a <a href="https://www
.monkees.com/news?page=1">monkees</a> website that a Christmas album has been released.
No text was copied, but wanted to give recognition to this website for the
latest news on the band that i have found. This also includes dates for Michael
Nesmith and the First National Band Redux, and a super deluxe edition album.

Received help from Robin Zigmond on the slack general chat room in regards to an
error i was having with setting an image as a background. After sharing some of
my code and screen-shot of my file directory, he pointed out that i forgot to add
../../ at front of the name for my image to be used.
