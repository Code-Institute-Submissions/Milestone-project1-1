Website status: <strong>Work in progress</strong>

<strong>Mile-stone Project 1</strong>

The purpose of this website is to inform fans of the Monkees band of latest news
music and events for the band. there will also be a section where people can
contact the band to book them for events such as weddings, charity events, view
pictures and listen to some of there songs. There will also be a page for
information on the band members.
 



<strong>UX:</strong>

This website was designed to allow the user to view some songs from the Monkees
albums. It also allows users to view up coming events, band pictures and to
contact the Monkees to hire them. The website is a simple one and easy to
navigate allowing the user to easily find the content there after. In the bottom
of every page are links to there social media pages and there youtube page so
that users can find information that Is not on the website. 

Features:

<strong>Current features:</strong>

Wiki links - On the band page each picture and band member name links the the
members own wikipedia page. I have done this because it would be much easier to
do so than create web pages for each band member.

Social media links - I have included links to the Monkees facebook, youtube,
instagram and twitter pages for the users to find more content that is not
included in this website.

Contact page - The contact us page allows users to message the band to book them
for events. It requires the user to provide there name and e-mail address to
submit the message, otherwise they will be given a message telling them to fill
in the indicated sections. Currently this does not send a message as I have not
learned how to do this yet.

<strong>Technology’s:</strong>



<a href=”http://getbootstrap.com”>Bootstrap</a> - I used Bootstrap to give the 
website a basic styling, suported with my own css file for a personal look.


<strong>Bug hunt:</strong>

I used the developers tools on Microsoft edge and discovered a few misplaced tags.
This has been fixed, after looking for more bugs i could not find any more errors
with the website. - 1/11/2018

After researching the Monkees on Google i discovered from a
<a href="https://www.monkees.com/news?page=1">monkees</a>
website that a Christmas album has been released. No text was copied, but wanted
to give recognition to this website for the latest news on the band that i have
found. This also includes dates for Michael Nesmith and the First National Band
Redux, and a super deluxe edition album.

Received help from Robin Zigmond on the slack general chat room in regards to an
error i was having with setting an image as a background. After sharing some of
my code and screen-shot of my file directory, he pointed out that i forgot to
add ../../ at front of the name for my image to be used.
