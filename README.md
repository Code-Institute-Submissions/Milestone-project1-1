After researching the monkees on google i discovered from a <a href="https://www
.monkees.com/news?page=1">monkees</a> website that a christmas album has been releised.
No text was copied, but wanted to give recognition to this website for the
latest news on the band that i have found. This also includes dates for Michael
Nesmith and the First National Band Redux, and a super delux edition album.

I used icons from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> for the 
dropdown menu and social media links.
