Testing:

Testing is done using the Preview option in Cloud 9 as well as viewing the page 
as a new window. Developer tools was used to fine tune the webpage to work then
changes made to the actual code. Dates of the tests I have done will be placed
next to the comments on the test I conducted, to show a timeline for each section
that has been checked for bugs, or errors.
